# Survival_Analysis
Collection of survival analyis mini projects
## Survival analysis scripts

I added a set of R scripts under `scripts/` that perform complete single-event survival analyses for each dataset in `data/`. Run them with `Rscript scripts/analyze_<dataset>.R` from the repository root. Outputs are written to `outputs/<dataset>/`.
